## InstantUssd App

This project recommends a file structure for incorporating [bitmarshals/instant-ussd](https://github.com/bitmarshals/instant-ussd) USSD library to your project.

It also provides the quickest way to boot up a fully functional USSD application within 3 minutes or less.

## Goals

- Speed up USSD development
- Ease maintenance of USSD code

## Features

- Minimal coding (provide USSD menus as config)
- Automatic screen to screen navigation
- Out of the box validation of user inputs
- Ready solutions for complex USSD flows involving going back and forth,
optional screens, looping set of screens,  jumping from screen to screen and 
resuming timed-out USSD sessions

Configure database tables and connection ([see below](https://github.com/davidbwire/instant-ussd-app#configuration))

### Via Composer

Run

```bash
$ composer create-project davidbwire/instant-ussd-app
```

Configure database tables and connection ([see below](https://github.com/davidbwire/instant-ussd-app#configuration))

## Configuration

Import instant ussd tables from [database.sql](config/database.sql) file and then add database connection params to the  [config file](config/iussd.config.php).

Finally, map incoming USSD requests to `http://your_domain_or_ip/callback.php`
